Big Room, the .eco domain registry, is committed to maintaining a responsible supply chain for the goods and services that it procures. To achieve this goal, Big Room has identified three key criteria by which suppliers are evaluated:

- Suppliers should have a published sustainability policy. This policy identifies the environmental actions taken by the supplier and is publicly available so that they can be held to account.
- We prefer working with suppliers who have formalized their environmental and social commitments by achieving reputable third party certifications.
- We recognize suppliers who have made a public commitment to climate action, by setting a net zero target for their business

These criteria are used to regularly evaluate both new and existing suppliers.

- New suppliers are evaluated against these criteria during the procurement process.
- Existing suppliers are reviewed against these criteria on an annual basis.


## Supplier Review (July 2025)
In our annual supplier review, we consider all suppliers[*](#fn-1) that account for more than 1% of .ecoâ€™s total annual expenses and evaluate them against the three criteria defined above. For those existing suppliers that do not meet the criteria, we petition for additional information as to when they will be able to meet the criteria.
