We believe that our environment needs to be shared by and accessible to all people. Everyone has a role in taking action to make our world more sustainable. Hence, it is paramount that the .eco community is open to all people regardless of ability or opportunity.

Big Room, the .eco registry operator, is committed to treating all people in a way that allows them to maintain their dignity and independence. We are committed to meeting the needs of people with disabilities in a timely manner, and will do so by preventing and removing barriers to accessibility and meeting accessibility requirements under international regulations. 

We strive to improve accessibility for our visitors and community members. We have audited our web properties by using [WAVE WebAIM](https://wave.webaim.org/). Currently, go.eco is conformant with [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) based on self-assessment.  [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/), our chat and engagement tool, has achieved a [WCAG 2.0 AA rating](https://www.intercom.com/blog/messenger-accessibility/).

We would like to hear your comments, questions and suggestions about the provision of our services for people with disabilities. Please send an [email](mailto:support@bigroom.eco) or use our [chat](javascript:Intercom('show')) to provide your feedback.
