benefit associated with a product or service.


## Minimum requirements to activate a .eco domain registration policy

To Activate a .eco domain name (i.e., have its Registry status changed from “Server Hold” to
“Delegated”), the .eco Registrant or someone duly authorised by the .eco Registrant must
complete the following two (2) steps within the .eco domain name’s Eco Profile.

1. Affirm the Eligibility of the .eco Registrant (OR where a different person or entity is
using the .eco domain name, typically where the domain name owner is different from

2. Take a pledge to show their commitment to uphold the Purpose and Principles of
.eco (“the Pledge”):

> “I/we pledge to support positive change for the planet and to be honest when sharing information on their environmental actions.”

These Minimum Requirements apply to all .eco domain names, including those registered in the Sunrise Period.


## Eco profile policy

In addition to affirming Eligibility for a .eco domain and taking the Pledge, the Eco Profile
also provides the opportunity for a .eco Registrant (or User) to enter optional additional
information about their environmental interests and activities.

.Eco Registrants (or Users) will be asked questions as part of the completion of their Eco
Profile on their efforts to support environmental, goals, values and interests.
Questions will be tailored to the nature of the Eligibility of the .eco Registrant (or User)
and will employ simple methods designed to foster engagement and action and minimize
abandonment.

Answers to these questions will be displayed on the respective .eco domain name’s Eco
Profile within the Eco System.

Corresponding Eco Profiles should be accessible via a link from all websites resolving from a
.eco domain name, and will also be searchable and accessible through the Eco System.

The Eco System will create a unique resource of freely available, current environmental
information.

.Eco Registrants (or Users) of Activated .eco domain name are required to:
* update or review their Eco Profiles at least annually, and show continued commitment
and actions toward sustainability over time;
* display environmental community-related content on and use their second-level
domains under .eco and Eco Profiles in a manner that supports environmental goals,
values and interests; and
* provide content on and use their .eco second-level domains and Eco Profiles in a
manner that is accurate, non-deceptive, and reliable (such content and use must also
encourage environmental awareness and action on sustainability).

The Registry will report annually on the Eco System to the .eco Organization.

## Eco profile compliance policy

### Eco Profile Verification

In order to maintain the integrity of the Eco Profiles and Eco System the .eco Registry will
proactively verify for compliance with the .eco Eligibility and Eco Profile Policies a proportion
of the Eco Profiles of Activated .eco domain names.

The Registry may notify Registrants and Users with Eco Profiles that contain data that
the Registry finds during its verification to be inaccurate, misleading or in any other ways
problematic; such findings being at the sole discretion of the Registry. The Registry will
provide guidance by email to the Registrant or User (with a copy to the Registrant’s Registrar)
on curing such deficiencies and in doing so will provide at least two (2) reminders in that
regard.

### Third Party Complaints

The Eco System provides a facility for other .eco Registrants and Users and the public
to report inaccurate, misleading or in any other ways problematic Eco Profile content to
the Registry. At its sole discretion the Registry will evaluate such reports. The Registry
may provide guidance by email to the respective Registrant or User (with a copy to the
Registrant’s Registrar) on curing such deficiencies in their Eco Profile and in doing so will
provide at least two (2) reminders in that regard.

### Sanctions

In the case of both Eco Profile Verification carried out by the Registry or Third Party
Complaints, the Registry may place on “Server Hold” status .eco domain names with Eco
Profiles that have been provided curative guidance by the Registry and after at least two (2)
reminders retain deficiencies, such deficiencies being at the sole discretion of the Registry. In
such cases the .eco Registrant will be notified accordingly by the Registry (with a copy to the
Registrant’s Registrar).

In addition, the Registry reserves the right to immediately place on “Server Hold” status .eco
domain names with Eco Profiles that in its sole discretion risk causing confusion or detriment
to the Registry, Registrants, Users or members of the public.

TTHESE SANCTIONS DO NOT LIMIT THE APPLICABILITY OF OR ANY ACTIONS AVAILABLE
TO THE REGISTRY UNDER THE .ECO ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY AND IN THE EVENT OF
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE .ECO ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY AND THE .ECO COMPLIANCE
POLICY THE .ECO ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY WILL PREVAIL.

### Community Eligibility Dispute Resolution (“CEDR”)

Registrants of .Eco domain names on “Server Hold” status as an outcome of Eco Profile
Verification by the Registry or a Third Party Complaint may refer the Eco Profile Verification
or Third Party Complaint, as applicable, to CEDR. Such Registrants will be provided with
instructions (with a copy to the Registrant’s Registrar) on instigating CEDR.

Third Party Complainants with complaints related to Eco Profiles of Active .eco domain
names (i.e. .eco domain name registrations not on “Sever Hold” status) which are not
resolved to the satisfaction of the Third Party Complainant through the Third Party
Complaints process may refer the Third Party Complaint to CEDR. Such Third Party
Complainants will be provided with instructions on instigating CEDR.

**The First Stage of CEDR**

The first stage of CEDR will consist of the Registry (or a party contracted by the Registry)
reviewing the relevant Eco Profile and relevant correspondence between the Registry and
the .eco Registrant and/or Third Party Complainant, as applicable, and provide a report to
the .eco Registrant and/or Third Party Complainant, as applicable, setting out its review of
the matter and its reasoning as to why the domain will either remain on “Server Hold” or
Activated status or have its status changed to “Server Hold” or Activated.

**The Second/Final Stage of CEDR**

If the First Stage of CEDR does not resolve the matter to the satisfaction of the .eco
Registrant or the Third Party Complainant, as applicable, they will have the opportunity
through the Registry with instructions provided at the time by the Registry, with a copy to
the Registrant’s Registrar where applicable, to refer the matter to an independent arbiter
approved and appointed by the Registry. This referral will require the payment of a fee by
the referrer and the referrer must submit a written explanation to the arbiter why the referrer
believes that the report and outcome from the First Stage of CEDR is incorrect. The arbiter
will then issue to the referrer and the Registry its findings and guidance on the matter and the
Registry will act accordingly.

The .eco Registrant and/or the Third Party Complainant, as applicable, agrees to be bound
by the outcome of the Second Stage of CEDR and will have no further recourse under the
.eco Policies.

The Registry reserves the exclusive right should the Second Stage of CEDR not resolve the
matter to the satisfaction of the Registry to refer the matter to the .eco Organization for a final
decision, which will be binding on the Registry and on the .eco Registrant and/or the Third
Party Complainant, as applicable.

ALL COMPLAINTS UNDER THIS ECO PROFILE COMPLIANCE POLICY INCLUDING THOSE
THAT RESULT IN CEDR OR A DECISION BY THE .ECO ORGANIZATION WILL RELATE
ONLY TO THE ECO PROFILE CONTENT AND THE REGISTRY SANCTION UNDER THIS
ECO PROFILE COMPLIANCE POLICY OF PLACING THE RELEVANT .ECO DOMAIN ON
“SERVER HOLD”. THE REGISTRANT’S REGISTRATION AGREEMENT WITH ITS REGISTRAR
IS UNRELATED AND UNAFFECTED AND REGISTRARS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE
ANY ACTION BUT REGISTRARS WILL BE COPIED ON ALL RELATED CORRESPONDENCE,
WHICH WILL BE BY EMAIL.

### Transparency

The Registry’s process for evaluating and resolving complaints and results of disputes under
this Eco Profile Compliance Policy will be made public. An annual report of all complaints and
actions taken will be made available to the .eco Organization. 

### Domain Name Cancellation

.Eco domain names that have been on “Server Hold” status for longer than twelve (12)
months either from their date of registration or after Activation due to Eco Profile Policy
Sanctions or for other reasons may be subject to cancellation by the Registry. Registrants
of such .eco domain names will be given at least thirty (30) and then ten (10) days’ notice by
email (with a copy to the Registrant’s Registrar) requesting them to Activate the .Eco domain
name and providing final curative guidance if the .eco domain name is in Server Hold status
because of Eco Profile Policy Sanctions before such cancellation takes effect.
