GET EARLY ACCESS TO A NEW EMBLEM OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT

Introducing .eco, a new top-level domain name created by and for the environmental community. .eco will launch in early 2017, but before it does, we’re giving away up to 500. Eco domains to the environmental movement.

Unlike other top-level domains, .eco will ONLY be available to organizations, business and people committed to positive change for the planet. Endorsed by over 50 environmental organizations including WWF and Greenpeace, .eco is a trusted verified symbol for you and others working on environmental issues.

Once .eco goes live to the public in the new year, securing names will become competitive and potentially expensive. So apply before December 16, 2016 for up to three .eco domain names for your organization or upcoming campaign.

“This is another quote. It also means nothing. We just needed something to take up the space where real words would.”

DOMAIN GRANT FAQ

What Kind of Name(s) Can I Apply For?

Apply for any common keyword or phrase that aligns with your issue or an upcoming campaign. For example, tuna.eco, ClimateAction.eco, or BanBatteryCages.eco. On February 1, 2017 you’ll get the opportunity to secure your organization’s name. Today, you’re applying for campaign keywords. Don’t miss this one-time chance to use the campaign domain you’ve always dreamed of, for free. You can apply for a .eco domain grant if:

- Your organization is a not-for-profit, charity or government
- Environmental work is central to your mission
- You plan to actively use your .eco domain within 12 months of receiving it

Who’s behind .eco?

.eco is a community-led domain and the only mission-based, impact-focused new top-level domain endorsed by WWF, Greenpeace, Conservation International and over 50 other organizations with environmental mandates. See who’s on the .eco council.

Who can apply for a .eco domain?

Unlike other top-level domains, .eco will ONLY be available to organizations, businesses and people committed to positive change for the planet. Every .eco domain applicant must pass a validation check before being granted their domain name of choice. With this validation process in place, .eco is a trusted, verified symbol for you and others working on environmental issues.

How will you make sure that organizations, businesses and people with .eco domains are really doing environmental work?

By working with the environmental community. The Community Council spent over two years developing the “.eco System”. Combined with clear rules and a “take-down” process, this approach will keep .eco working for the environmental community. Learn more about the .eco policy development process.

What is a .eco domain grant?

In early 2017, .eco will launch into the broader community. Before that happens, we’re granting a limited number of free .eco domain names to ensure environment organizations get early access to .eco domains. This is the best chance to secure the campaign domain you’ve always dreamt of, for free. Once .eco goes live to the public in the new year, securing names will become competitive and could be expensive.

Who can apply for a .eco domain grant?

The Domain Grant program is open to any environment NGO, non-profit or government for whom environmental protection is a central mandate. You can also apply if your organization is a member of a recognized coalition with an environmental mission.

How many names can my organization apply for?

Each organization or individual can submit up to three applications for one name each. To help us ensure everyone gets a name they want, please rank your names in order of preference.

What criteria does .eco use to award domain grants?

The primary criteria .eco is using to award domain grants are:

- Relevance of your proposal. When a user visits your granted .eco domain, the site content is relevant to the keyword and supports your org’s purpose and environmental mission. Ask yourself, is this what the average internet user would expect to find here?
- Scope. Your project has reach and impact aligned with your goals.
- Diversity. It is important to us that the cohort of .eco domain grant recipients be geographically and culturally diverse and represent a variety of environmental issue areas.

Where there are multiple strong applications for the same name, governments will be granted the domain first, followed by a non-profit. Oldest non-profits, by founding date, will be offered the name before newly-founded organizations. Learn more about these policy guidelines designed by the .eco council.


What kinds of names can I apply for?

Think common or generic nouns, or verbs, that represent your organization or campaign. If you organize around climate issues, you might consider applying for ClimateAction.eco, Biodiversity.eco or ClimateNeutral.eco. Launching a campaign to protect honey bees? Apply for bee.eco. You get the idea. On February 1, 2017 you’ll get the opportunity to secure your organization’s name. Today, you’re applying for campaign keywords.

When will I find out if my organizations receives a domain grant?

The initial phase of applications for domain grants close at the end of November and grants will be awarded in January, 2016.

When can I use my .eco domain?

If you receive a domain grant in December, you can start using your domain in May, 2017.

Will I be able to run a .eco domain and another web domain name at the same time?

Yes. Having a .eco name doesn’t mean you have to give up your other sites. It can be used for a specific campaign, or be a place for a particular project.

Do I get to keep my granted .eco domain name forever?

Approved .eco keyword grants remain in the pool of environmental community grant names forever. Grantees will have 12 months from May 1, 2017 to launch something on their .eco domain name. If your grant name is not in use inside the 12-month activation window, we’ll be in touch to discuss a plan for your use of the granted domain name(s) or returning them to the community. As long as names are being actively used, there is no limit on the duration of the grant. In other words, if you’re actively using your .eco domain, it’s yours forever. But, if you stop using your granted .eco domain, it will be returned to the sandbox so that other non-profits can apply to use that .eco domain name.


Will .eco give back to the environmental community?

Yes. We will create independent foundation that will allocate a significant portion of the sales of .eco names to help the environment. You can read more about our history and commitment to the environmental community. Importantly, environmental groups will play a key role in making sure .eco funds are well spent.
