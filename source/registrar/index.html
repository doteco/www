		<h2>For the environment &emdash; why .eco?</h2>


		<p>The general public will be looking for the .eco extension as it gives companies and organisations credibility as it fast becomes the global standard to look for. As a term, eco is already:</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<p><strong>Specific:</strong> “eco” is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary with a single definition: “not harming the environment”</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<p><strong>Applicable:</strong> As a combining form, eco naturally affixes itself to any noun or verb to generate meaning. It can be used with products, companies, organizations, individuals, actions, etc. Anything that can “not harm the environment” can be eco.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<p><strong>Recognized:</strong> Perhaps as importantly, eco is recognized as an environmental term in most languages,  including in Latin America and Asia.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>Such will be the impact and global awareness of this initiative, only companies and organisations that use the .eco domain name will be trusted with their environmental claims. It is the new symbol that will be used to denote a true commitment to sustainability.</p>
