One of the main challenges that we face when confronting and addressing environmental issues is long-term thinking. Issues like climate change, biodiversity loss, toxic waste and plastic pollution accumulate over time. There isnâ€™t a single crisis for everyone to rally around and there are no simple solutions. We need to be committed for the long haul and start planning years ahead to make the impact we need.

At .eco, we want to do our small part to support everyone in the environmental community thinking long term. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re working with our domain retail partners to reduce the cost of multi-year domain registrations by up to **20%**. If you register a .eco domain for 2 or more years with participating retailers, the cost of registration will be reduced by **$10 USD** or more for each year beyond the first year.

Currently this promotion is a trial and is only available for the next **12 months (March 2024 - February 2025)**.
