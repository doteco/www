For business, trying to reach customers through this blizzard is a big problem. The volume of email means that organizations need every advantage they can find when it comes to standing out in someone’s inbox. Getting a customer’s attention is half the battle.

That’s why Eric Hudson, founder of [Preserve](https://preserve.eco), a company that designs household products from recycled materials, started using his .eco address when he reached out to customers and partners.

Since the company was founded in 1996, they’ve used [www.preserveproducts.com](https://preserveproducts.com) as their domain name. But when [preserve.eco](https://preserve.eco) was made available, Eric saw the advantages of using the name immediately.

> Advantages of a custom domain:
> 1. Preserve.eco elegantly represents the company brand.
> 2. It’s sort and memorable.
> 3. Customers know Preserve cares about the environment.

Because your email address is the first thing people see when you send them a note, it is your first impression in your digital communication. And good marketers know the value of a good first impression. Here’s how to replicate Eric’s strategy:

## How to set up your .eco email address

### Step 1: Find the perfect name
That just takes a second. You can use the [.eco domain search](/search/) tool to check real time availability or go to your favourite registrar and find the name there.

### Step 2: Choose an email provider
There are lots of great email providers. Here are a few examples:
* **ICloud Mail** if you use Apple, Mac and iPhone.
* **Gmail** if you use Chrome and Android.
* **Outlook Online** if you work with Microsoft Platforms.
* **Proton Mail** if data security is a primary focus.

### Step 3: Set up your signature
Make the most of your email address by setting up a signature file that appears at the foot of all your messages. You can also include a link to your eco profile that describes the things you’re doing to make the world a better place. Here are some tips:

> A good email signature
> 1. Is clean and consistent. Avoid using too many fonts, colours or graphics
> 2. Is simple. Include only relevant information like your name, title, web address and phone number
> 3. Connects. Offers the opportunity to learn more by linking to your social icons and [.eco trust-mark](https://support.go.eco/en/articles/578592-what-is-the-eco-trustmark)
