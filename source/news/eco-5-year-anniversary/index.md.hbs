From our first conversations about .eco, we knew it had to stand for something. It had to be trusted and transparent, impactful and accessible.

Over the past 5 years, weâ€™ve been heartened and encouraged by how this mission has been embraced by [companies](https://profiles.eco/profile/type/business), [organizations](https://profiles.eco/profile/type/nonprofit), [individuals](https://profiles.eco/profile/type/individual), [academic institutions](https://profiles.eco/profile/type/educational), [governments](https://profiles.eco/profile/type/government), and [others](https://profiles.eco/profile/type/other) who have registered .eco domains.

Whether theyâ€™re large or small, working locally or globally, thousands of doers, leaders, activists, thinkers, and makers have found a home at .eco. Weâ€™re proud to call them all members of the .eco community.

We have a great foundation to build on, and weâ€™re continuing to build and grow the .eco community. Working with our 100+ registrars and through localized sites like [kauf.eco](https://kauf.eco) and [allez.eco](https://allez.eco), we want to reach the millions of people who donâ€™t know about .eco â€“ but should.

As we look forward to the next 5 years and beyond, we know thereâ€™s more work to do â€“ for all of us. Faced with a climate emergency, weâ€™re all going to have to do better, faster, and with less impact. 

Itâ€™s daunting, but one of the most rewarding things about stewarding the .eco community is seeing the inspiring work being done by .eco community members.

Weâ€™re 5 years in, but weâ€™re just getting started. [Join us today](/search/).
