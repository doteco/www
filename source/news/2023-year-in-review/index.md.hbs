### .eco Community in 2023

Every member of the .eco community activates a [.eco profile](https://profiles.eco/) before they can start using their .eco domain. A .eco profile is a lightweight, structured sustainability policy created by each community member, disclosing how they are working to support the environmental movement.

In 2023, 1400 .eco profiles were activated. 76% of those are associated with [businesses](https://profiles.eco/profile/type/business). The profiles activated in 2023 have locations in [115 unique countries](https://profiles.eco/profile/location). The top 5 countries represented this year are the USA, UK, Germany, France and Spain.

Every .eco profile lists the [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) that the .eco community member is working towards. This year, each of the 17 SDGs were represented. The most popular SDG supported by the .eco community is [Climate Action (#13)](https://profiles.eco/profile/focus/climate), followed by [Responsible Consumption and Production (#12)](https://profiles.eco/profile/focus/consumptionProduction), and [Sustainable Cities and Communities (#11)](https://profiles.eco/profile/focus/communities).

### Inclusion and Accessibility
The environmental community needs to be inclusive of everyone, regardless of ability. To support this, we worked to improve the accessibility of the .eco profile system and our other web properties. We published an [Accessibility Statement in support of this goal](https://profiles.eco/user/accessibility). If you are aware of ways in which we can improve the accessibility of these websites, [please let us know](mailto:support@bigroom.eco).

### Climate Action
We reduced the carbon footprint of the .eco domain registry by [3.68% in 2023](/impact/ghg-report-2023/). Most of that reduction came from optimizing the energy use associated with .eco websites. We achieved a 42% reduction in the estimated emissions associated with [profiles.eco](https://profiles.eco/) and a 59% reduction for [go.eco](https://go.eco/). An additional upside of these improvements is that they also make the websites load much faster.

We are looking at ways to further reduce our footprint, targeting an additional 4% reduction for 2024, and we will continue to share our learnings with the .eco community.

### .eco community on Slack
This year, we set up a Slack community to foster conversation and interaction between members of the .eco community. Currently, 118 .eco members have joined the Slack community. We have had good discussions about .eco eligibility, and shared stories about what we're working on. It’s a great forum to introduce your organization to members of the community and get support. You can find the invitation link to join the community by logging into the .eco profile system and [visiting your account page](https://profiles.eco/user/account).


### .eco retailers
One of our goals is to ensure that .eco is available wherever members of the environmental community are looking to register domain names. We have added 41 .eco retailers [listed on go.eco](/search/) and 10 to our [list of eco-friendly retailers](/news/finding-a-green-domain-retailer/). If there are domain retailers that are missing from the list that you would like to see offer .eco, [let us know](mailto:support@bigroom.eco).

### Best wishes for 2024
We wish everyone working to create positive change for our planet all the best for 2024. We know that these can be challenging times and that work that you’re doing can be a struggle. We’re here to help amplify your voice and we’re stronger through working together. Please reach out if there are ways that we can [support you with your mission](mailto:support@bigroom.eco).
