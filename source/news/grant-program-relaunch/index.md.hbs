A central part of our mission at .eco is to support and amplify the work of the global environmental community - the community that helped to create the .eco domain.

When we launched .eco, we granted over **100 free .eco domain names** to environmental non-profits to help them establish their presence online and support their new campaigns. 

Coinciding with this year's Giving Tuesday, we're pleased to announce that we're relaunching our [.eco Domain Grants program](/grants/) to make .eco domain names available to eligible non-profits.

We'll cover the cost of your .eco domain for the first year, so that's one less expense you have to worry about.

Whether you're a new non-profit, launching a campaign, or are an established organization looking to move to a .eco domain name, we encourage you to [apply for a .eco domain grant](/grants).

We can't wait to see how you'll use your .eco domain to help create a more sustainable future.
