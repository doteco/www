When we first launched .eco, we granted over **100 free .eco domain names** to environmental non-profits. 
Since that point, we have been wanting to resume giving back to the environmental community.
Coinciding with this year's Giving Tuesday, we're pleased to announce that we're relaunching our [.eco Domain Grants program](/grants/) to give away .eco domain names for free to eligible non-profits.

If you have recently started up a non-profit or are launching a new campaign or are a pre-existing organization that is looking to move to a .eco domain name, we encourage [you to apply](/grants).
We will cover the cost of your .eco domain for the first year, so that's one less expense that you have to worry about.
