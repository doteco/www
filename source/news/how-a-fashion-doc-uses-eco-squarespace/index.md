How do you use Squarespace to connect with consumers to tell the story of the environmental risks of fashion? How do we highlight the leaders who can change this industry for the better? Documentaries tell the story Tweets can’t. In an over-informed world, film can cut through the noise and really change opinions. **That’s What River Blue has been doing**.

Roger Williams, David Mcilvride and Mark Angelo have been winning awards at documentary film festivals around the world for shining a light on how our demand for clothing is polluting some of the world’s most important rivers.

The next step for River Blue was distribution. They needed a “one stop shop” to drive all of the awareness they are generating towards.

> They chose: [www.watchriverblue.eco](https://www.watchriverblue.eco) as that go-to home, because:
>
> 1. **It embeds a call to action in the URL**
> 2. **The .eco ending makes the environmental focus clear**

River Blue is a documentary, so their primary goal is to get people to watch their film. River Blue knew they needed to keep it simple.

Using — **Squarespace** and **Namecheap** — they pulled together a simple template with a preview of the film and their core channels in under a day.
