For the past few months, we have been working with [Inhabit](https://inhabit.eco) to review and [audit](/news/carbon-footprint-audit/) our [carbon footprint](/news/carbon-footprint-2022/). Our goal is to follow a rigorous, internationally-recognized reporting standard. We have learn a tonne about greenhouse gas reporting in the process. With the help of Inhabit, we have now published an [ISO 14064 compliant report of our greenhouse gas emissions for our 2022 fiscal year](/impact/ghg-report-2022).

Please check out the report and [let us know](javascript:Intercom('show')) if you have any questions or comments. This is an area that is rapidly evolving as more technology companies take climate action and account for their emissions.

### What's next?

We are in the process of selecting a carbon offset provider to offset our residual emissions for this year. Within the next few weeks, we will provide more information about which carbon offset projects we will be supporting. Once the offsets have been purchased we will be able to complete compliance with [PAS 2060](https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/PAS-2060-Carbon-Neutrality/) and formalize our declaration of carbon neutrality.
