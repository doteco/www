Recently, we wrote [a feature about the Green Web Check](https://go.eco/news/green-web-check-ecolabel/) from the Green Web Foundation. [Green Web Check](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/) is a quick and easy-to-use tool that checks to see if a given website is using an eco-friendly web host. It looks up the website’s IP address in a database listing data centers that are powered using 100% renewable electricity.

We went ahead and looked up all active .eco websites using Green Web Check to see how many .eco domains are using eco-friendly web hosts. In this post, we’ll share the results. Also, we commit to regularly re-running this analysis, so check back here for the latest data.

## The results

Over 2,300 .eco community members are hosting their websites on eco-friendly web hosts That represents approximately **31%** of active .eco websites. If you’re keen to see the raw data, here’s a list of all .eco websites included in the analysis.

> Presently, 31% of .eco websites use eco-friendly hosting. 

.eco domains currently use over **90** different eco-friendly web hosts. Here are the **top 10** eco-friendly hosting providers with the largest number of .eco domains:

## What’s next

If you’ve already registered a .eco domain and joined the [.eco community](https://profiles.eco) you can run Green Web Check against your website. If your website is using eco-friendly hosting, you can add a badge to your [.eco profile](https://profiles.eco/profile/certification/green-web-check) attesting that ([this article explains how](https://go.eco/news/green-web-check-ecolabel/)). If not, there are a range of eco-friendly hosts that you could consider instead.

If you are looking for an eco-friendly host, check out our [post on eco-friendly .eco domain retailers](https://go.eco/news/finding-a-green-domain-retailer/) - they also offer web hosting services.

And if you’re a .eco domain retailer or an eco-friendly web host not listed in the Green Web Check database, you can [register with the Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/register/) along with proof of your sustainability claims.

We fully subscribe to the goals of the Green Web Foundation to reaching a **fossil-fuel free Internet by 2030** and we believe that the .eco community can lead the way with this as the largest community of eco-friendly websites on the planet.
