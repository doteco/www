### Climate Action Impact
This is the year that we dedicated ourselves to [Climate Action](https://profiles.eco/profile/focus/climate). With the growing scope and scale of climate change-related disasters, we felt compelled to do what we could to address the Climate Crisis.

This year we set a target to become the first carbon neutral domain registry and have been sharing our journey on this site. Here are some of the steps we’ve taken:
* Declared a Climate Emergency and committed ourselves to climate action
* Joined the global movement to address climate change through Race to Zero, SME Climate Hub and Business Declares
* Measured and started reducing our carbon footprint
* Partnered with Inhabit.eco to validate our carbon neutral claims
* Partnered with the Green Web Foundation to help the .eco community

### Community Impact
This year, we have named and featured 15 new [.eco champions](/champions/). This year’s group includes businesses, nonprofits and individuals working on everything from sustainable toilet paper and packaging to electric vehicle charging infrastructure and eco-fiction. If you are interested in becoming a .eco champion, please [get in touch](mailto:support@bigroom.eco).

We also have a mission to advise our community in making more eco-friendly choices. By sharing what we learn and working together, we can amplify our impact beyond what any of us can do individually. To this end, this year we have published [10 articles](/news/) about eco-friendly technology choices and climate action.

### Compliance Impact
One of our main responsibilities is to ensure that .eco stands for the values of the environmental community upon which it was founded. To counter issues of abuse, misalignment and greenwashing, the .eco profile system creates transparency into intended use of .eco domains and the entities that own them. Members of the environmental community and the general public [can report .eco profiles or .eco websites](https://support.go.eco/en/articles/578594-what-happens-when-i-report-a-eco-profile) that contain inaccurate information that is in violation of our acceptable use policies. When we receive a notification of a potential misuse of a .eco domain, we launch an investigation and, if necessary, contact the owner to remediate the issue.

This year, we received 8 reports that we have subsequently investigated. 4 of those involved following up with the domain owner. There have been two cases of .eco domains being suspended.

### Impact Plan for 2023

#### Achieve carbon neutral certification
We have made good progress on our goal of getting to carbon neutral and our target is to get there in 2023. The primary outstanding tasks include purchasing offsets to cover our outstanding emissions and completing carbon neutral certification. We are aiming to meet the [PAS2060 criteria for being carbon neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSI_PAS_2060). We are also targeting a 10% reduction in our Scope 3 emissions through improvements in efficiency of our services, while continuing to grow the .eco community.

#### Renewed BCorp certification
Prior to first launching .eco, we had successfully completed our [BCorp certification](https://www.bcorporation.net/). As anyone who has been through BCorp certification knows, it’s quite a bit of work to not just get the certification but also to maintain and renew it year after year. We had allowed our certification to lapse, but it had always been our plan to renew it. 2023 is the year that we will do so.

#### Granting .eco domains
When we first launched .eco, we granted .eco domains to many environmental NGOs. The grant secured their name and covered the first year of registration.

This year, we will be restarting this programme, making .eco domains available for free or a reduced fee for the first year for eligible environmental organizations where the cost of registration is a barrier to getting a web site set up.

#### Elevating more .eco champions
We are in the privileged position of being inspired by the great impact work that is being done by the [.eco community](https://profiles.eco/). We want to continue to share and amplify the message of .eco members. We will be continuing to identify amazing members of the .eco community to elevate and promote.

#### Encouraging eco-friendly digital services
We will continue to serve as a trusted and impartial source of information and recommendations for the .eco community in choosing digital services that have reduced environmental impact. In 2022, [31% of .eco domains are hosted using eco-friendly web hosts](/news/eco-friendly-hosts-results/). We have a target for 2023 to boost that to 40%.

### What do you think?

We are privileged to operate the .eco top-level domain for and on behalf of the global environmental community. By focusing on Climate Action for 2022 and 2023, we believe where we can have the greatest impact. Do you agree? Are there other things that you would like to see the registry work on? If so, [drop us a line](mailto:support@bigroom.eco) and let us know.
