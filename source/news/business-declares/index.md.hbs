When we first took the steps to declare a [Climate Emergency](https://go.eco/news/we-declare-a-climate-emergency/) and commit ourselves to [reach net zero](https://go.eco/news/climate-action-plan-2022/), we looked around for ways to share our commitment and hold ourselves accountable to our targets.

We learned about [Business Declares](https://businessdeclares.com/) through [LEAP](https://leap.eco), one of our awesome [.eco champions](https://go.eco/champions/), who provide creative support to the organization. Business Declares is a network of businesses that have declared a Climate Emergency and are committed to reach carbon neutrality.

> We are proud to announce that we have joined the Business Declares network. Our aim is to be net zero before 2030 by reducing our emissions and impact on biodiversity.
