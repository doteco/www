When we first took the steps to declare a [Climate Emergency](https://go.eco/news/we-declare-a-climate-emergency/) and commit ourselves to [reach net zero](https://go.eco/news/climate-action-plan-2022/), we looked around for ways to share our commitment and hold ourselves accountable to our targets.

We learned about [Business Declares](https://businessdeclares.com/) through [LEAP](https://leap.eco), one of our awesome [.eco champions](https://go.eco/champions/), who provide creative support to the organization. Business Declares is a network of businesses that have declared a Climate Emergency and are committed to reach carbon neutrality.

> We are proud to announce that we have joined the Business Declares network. Our aim is to be net zero before 2030 by reducing our emissions and impact on biodiversity.

### Updated Declaration (2025)

In light of our growing collective understanding of the escalating crises faced by life on our planet, Business Declares has updated their [Manifesto](https://businessdeclares.com/s/The-Business-Declares-Manifesto.pdf) to reflect the interdependency between climate, ecological and social conditions that are accelerating this polycrisis.

> In acknowledgment of the escalating, interdependent crises the world faces, and together with other Business Declares members, we declare there is a climate, ecological and social emergency.

We make this declaration with urgency and in certainty that the impacts these crises will have on our society and economy, let alone the environment, will be near-term, fundamental and far reaching for all, including ourselves, our business and our stakeholders.

Our declaration, in line with the Business Declares Manifesto, builds on our [existing sustainability policies and impact reports](/impact/). In addition, we commit to:
- Continue annually publish our impact and transition plans
- Use the power of collective action to advocate for the transformations necessary to bring about positive change for our planet
