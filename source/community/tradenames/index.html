		<p>In early 2017, we invited non-profits to reserve .eco domains for their trade names. This early-access program was a way to acknowledge non-profits for endorsing the .eco domain and for helping us create this new online home for the environmental community.</p>

		<p>If you applied for your trade name before March 31, youâ€™ll find out if your application was successful by April 18, 2017.</p>

	<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

	<div class="content-section">
		<h5>What is a trade name?</h5>
		<p>A trade name is a name by which an organization is commonly known. It can also be an acronym.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content-section">
		<h5>How much will my .eco community trade name domain cost?</h5>
		<p>.eco trade names are free for the first year. Renewals will be between US $75 - $100, depending on what retailer you renew them at.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content-section">
		<h5>How do I activate my .eco community trade name domain?</h5>
		<p>When we write to tell you if you have been successful in reserving your .eco trade name, we will let you know how to activate your new domain.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content-section">
		<h5>Why can I only reserve a .eco community trade name, not activate it today?</h5>
		<p>Like all new top-level domains, we're providing a window for trademark holders to reserve their marks before our public launch. In the domain industry, this is known as the "sunrise period." After the sunrise period is complete, we will be able allocate community trade name domains, starting from April 18, 2017.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content-section">
		<h5>Can I reserve a .eco domain name other than for my trade name?</h5>
		<p>At this time, you can only reserve a .eco domain for your trade name. We do have an early adopter program. If you are ready to start using your .eco domain right away, you can email hello@home.eco with your idea. We are especially interested in hearing from small businesses and non-profits. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="content-section">
		<h5>Why is the trade names program only for non-profits? </h5>
		<p>The support for the .eco community domain by non-profits like WWF, Greenpeace and Conservation International is a key part of what made the .eco domain a reality. Helping the non-profit community protect their trade names is one way we can acknowledge their important role in creating this new online home for the environmental community.</p>
