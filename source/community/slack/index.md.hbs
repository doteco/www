### Purpose

The goal of this Slack community is to provide a forum for members of the .eco community to meet and interact. As a community top-level domain, we operate for and on behalf of the global environmental community. This Slack community is also an opportunity for you, as a member of the .eco community, to help guide and shape the operation of the .eco top-level domain.

### Joining the community
To join the Slack community, you need a sign up link. If you subscribe to the quarterly .eco community newsletter, we include a sign up link there. If you haven’t received the newsletter and would like to join, you can also find the signup link on your [account page on profiles.eco](https://profiles.eco/user/account).

You can access the community on Slack either via the web interface that runs in your browser or by [downloading the client for your operating system](https://slack.com/downloads/mac).

### Getting started with the community
Once you have joined the community, we recommend customizing your [Slack profile](https://dotecocommunity.slack.com/account/profile). You can upload a photo, your title and organizer you belong to and a link to your .eco website.

Once you’re done, come into the **#say-hi** channel and introduce yourself to the rest of the community. Please warmly welcome other members when they come and say hi. 

You will have been added to a few channels by default. There are a number of pre-existing channels that you can also join if the topic is of interest to you. If you create a new channel to discuss a specific topic, you can announce in the **#general** channel. Aside from announcements, please keep conversations out of the **#general** channel and in a topic-specific channel or in **#random**.
