		<h2>Shipboard Learning for the Planet</h2>
			<p>There are lessons you learn while spending weeks on a sailboat that can’t be taught in a classroom. </br>That’s the idea behind SEA Semester, an unorthodox study abroad program that teaches students about the ocean, while sailing upon its blue waves.</p>

		<p>SEA Semester introduces students from varying disciplines – science, humanities, and ‘undecided’ – to the powerful role of the ocean in the environment, over four to six weeks aboard a 134-foot sailboat.</p>

		<p>“Environmentalism and conservation are core elements of SEA Semester’s mission,” said Lauren Zike, Web and Publications Coordinator at SEA Semester.  “Students are focused on gaining a deeper understanding of critical issues including climate change, sustainability, biodiversity, human impact on the environment, and environmental justice.”</p>

		<p>Students also get to explore off-the-beaten-path ports, from Barbados to New Zealand. It sounds like a dream yachting experience, but it’s not without its challenges.</p>

		<p>“They tend to have a much deeper understanding of their own environmental impacts on land after spending weeks at sea living in a self-sustaining microcosm,” said Zike. “Students typically say that it was harder than they thought it would be, both in terms of the academics and the shipboard experience.”</p>

		<p>Using the .eco domain was a natural choice for SEA Semester, who is using the domain to communicate the environmental aspects of their brand. Backed by more than 50 environmental organizations, .eco is a new web address ending for anyone committed to positive change for the planet.</p>

		<p>“The undergraduate audience consumes information at a rapid pace from a wide variety of sources,” said Zike. “So anything we can do to quickly impress upon them the basis of our mission will be to our advantage.”</p>

		<p>When people see the .eco symbol, they can be sure that the organization is committed to their environmental mandate.</p>
