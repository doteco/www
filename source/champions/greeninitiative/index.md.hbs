# Green Initiative: .eco&nbsp;champion

## {{{excerpt}}}

![{{header-img-alt}}]({{header-img}})

_We connected with **Yves Hemelryck**, Head of Communications at the Green Initiative about their climate certifications, eco-restoration projects and sustainable tourism._

### What is the Green Initiative? What was the motivation to launch the company?

Green Initiative is an international climate certification and advisory services company dedicated to accelerating the transition to a climate- and nature-positive planet. Our mission is to empower organizations to integrate climate action into their operations, aligning with the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The motivation behind launching Green Initiative stemmed from the urgent need to provide science-based, transparent solutions that not only mitigate environmental impact but also foster sustainable growth and ecosystem regeneration.

### What solutions do you offer to address climate and nature risks?

We offer a comprehensive suite of solutions to help organizations assess, reduce, and compensate their environmental footprint—while actively contributing to ecosystem restoration and biodiversity conservation:

**Climate Certifications:**
UNESCO World Heritage site Machu Picchu become the world’s first carbon-neutral tourism destination through our certification process, setting a powerful example for sustainable cultural tourism.

**Nature-Positive Initiatives:**
Through our [Forest Friends](https://forestfriends.eco/) program, businesses can support high-impact ecosystem restoration and biodiversity conservation efforts. In Costa Rica’s Osa Peninsula, Forest Friends partners have already helped plant thousands of native trees in one of the planet’s most biodiverse regions.

**Advisory Services:**
We offer strategic advisory services to integrate climate and nature-based action into organizational operations. For example, we have helped [Alphamundi Group](https://www.alphamundigroup.com/), an impact investment firm, measure their emissions, adopt net-zero strategies, and earn verified climate certifications in alignment with international best practices.

Together, these solutions enable organizations to move beyond neutrality and actively contribute to a climate and nature-positive future—with real, measurable impact.

### What types of clients do you work with? Which regions are you focused on?

Our diverse clientele includes multinational corporations, tourism destinations, small and medium-sized enterprises, and governmental organizations. We operate globally, with a significant presence in countries like the USA, France, Sweden, Brazil, Peru, and Costa Rica, where we collaborate on various conservation and sustainable tourism projects.

### You currently offer 3 different climate certifications. What are these certifications? Why did you decide to set your own certification standard?

Our primary certifications include:
* **Carbon Measured**: For organizations that have completed a verified emissions inventory, demonstrating a commitment to understanding and managing their carbon footprint.
* **Carbon Neutral**: For organizations that have measured, reduced, and offset their emissions, achieving a balance between emitted and compensated greenhouse gases.
* **Climate Positive**: For organizations that have gone beyond neutrality by removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit, creating an environmental benefit.

Additionally, our Forest Friends Certifications acknowledge varying levels of engagement in ecosystem restoration and biodiversity conservation efforts.

We established our own certification standards to ensure they are comprehensive, science-based, and aligned with international frameworks. This approach allows us to provide tailored solutions that address specific industry challenges and opportunities, ensuring meaningful and verifiable climate action.

### You also partner with conservation organizations to restore natural areas and protect biodiversity. How do you select your conservation partners?

Our conservation partners are selected based on:
- Proven Expertise: Demonstrated success in ecological restoration, reforestation, and biodiversity conservation.
- Alignment with Global Goals: Commitment to the objectives of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and the SDGs.
- Community Engagement: Active involvement of local communities, ensuring that projects deliver social as well as environmental benefits.
- Transparency and Accountability: Ability to provide clear reporting and undergo independent verification of project outcomes.

For instance, our Forest Friends program collaborates with local organizations in biodiversity hotspots like the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica and the Tambopata region in Peru to implement reforestation and conservation initiatives.

### You recently won an award for ecotourism. How does this connect with your other work?

Green Initiative was honored with the [World Sustainable Travel &amp; Hospitality Award (WSTHA](https://greeninitiative.eco/2024/11/29/green-initiative-and-machu-picchu-a-winning-partnership-for-climate-and-nature-sustainability-through-regenerative-tourism/)) as the World's Leading Sustainable Organisation in 2024, recognizing our contributions to sustainable tourism and climate action. This accolade aligns with our broader mission by highlighting the importance of integrating environmental stewardship into tourism. By certifying destinations like Machu Picchu as carbon neutral, we demonstrate how tourism can be leveraged to promote conservation, reduce emissions, and support local communities, embodying the principles of regenerative tourism.

### How did you learn about .eco domains and why did you choose it for your websites?

We chose a .eco domain for our website to reflect our unwavering commitment to environmental sustainability. The .eco domain is specifically designed for organizations dedicated to positive environmental change, providing a clear signal to our stakeholders of our mission and values. This choice enhances our brand's credibility and aligns with our goal of promoting transparency and trust in the sustainability sector.
