# Wype: .eco&nbsp;champion

## {{{excerpt}}}

![{{header-img-alt}}]({{header-img}})

_We reached **Arman Bogosyan**, founder of bamboo toilet and tissue paper company, Wype, about how bamboo is a better alternative to traditional paper options._

### What is Wype?

Wype is dedicated to reimagining hygiene routines with a focus on personal wellness and environmental stewardship. Crafted from organic bamboo, Wype’s toilet paper reflects its commitment to sustainability while prioritizing skin safety and eco-consciousness. Unlike traditional options, Wype toilet paper is unwhitened and unbleached, avoiding bleach, formaldehyde, PFAS, and BPA. This ensures a safer, chemical-free experience while providing a biodegradable product that respects the planet.

By using bamboo—a renewable resource that grows rapidly and regenerates naturally—Wype helps protect North American forests from deforestation caused by traditional toilet paper production. Each tissue serves as more than a convenience—it’s a meaningful step towards reducing environmental harm and supporting a healthier planet.

At Wype, sustainability and comfort go hand in hand. Our mission is to empower individuals and businesses to adopt eco-friendly lifestyles without compromising on quality. Wype is more than a product—it’s a movement for better living and a cleaner future. Together, we can elevate personal care while making a tangible difference for the earth.


### Why is bamboo a better option for toilet paper?

Bamboo is an eco-friendly alternative to traditional toilet paper because of its renewability and low environmental impact. Unlike trees, which can take decades to mature, bamboo grows astonishingly fast—up to 35 inches per day for certain species—and regenerates after harvesting without requiring replanting. Meanwhile, the demand for virgin wood pulp toilet paper results in mass deforestation. It is estimated that around 27,000 trees are cut down every day for toilet paper production, totaling nearly 10 million trees annually.

This practice not only harms ecosystems but also reduces vital carbon sinks that help combat climate change. By transitioning to bamboo toilet paper, which requires fewer resources to grow and harvest, individuals can reduce their environmental footprint. Bamboo farming uses less water, minimal land, and avoids the destruction caused by logging mature forests.

Additionally, bamboo toilet paper offers comparable softness and strength, ensuring a functional, guilt-free alternative that promotes sustainability and protects forests for future generations



### What part of making toilet paper has the biggest environmental impact?

The biggest environmental impact comes from the sourcing and production process of traditional toilet paper. Deforestation for wood pulp contributes to significant habitat destruction, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and biodiversity loss. Additionally, traditional production processes often involve chemicals, excessive water usage, and energy consumption, all of which harm the planet. By switching to bamboo-based toilet paper, we cut down these impacts and embrace a cleaner, greener process.

### How are you embracing sustainability throughout your product design and delivery?

At Wype, sustainability is more than just an initiative—it’s core to our mission. From product design to delivery, we strive to minimize environmental impact while prioritizing quality. Our toilet paper is crafted from organic bamboo, a renewable resource that regenerates rapidly. It’s also unwhitened and unbleached, eliminating the need for harmful chemicals like bleach, formaldehyde, PFAS, and BPA, ensuring both skin safety and ecological responsibility.

Our manufacturing partner, [LC Paper](https://www.lcpaper.com/), shares our sustainability values and leads by example. With over 140 years of experience, LC Paper was the first B Corp-certified paper manufacturer globally, underscoring its commitment to creating zero-impact products. Their factory utilizes renewable energy from 8,500 solar panels, powering one of the region's largest solar farms. Additionally, they employ biomass and biomethane energy to ensure thermal energy production remains sustainable. No plastic is used in packaging, and shipments rely on electrified trains whenever possible to minimize carbon emissions.

This partnership allows Wype to deliver eco-conscious products that are traceable, biodegradable, and fully aligned with our vision for a cleaner, greener future. By integrating circular processes and renewable energy into every step, Wype offers a truly sustainable solution for modern hygiene.

### Where do you source your materials from?

Our bamboo is responsibly harvested from regions in Asia where farming practices prioritize sustainability and environmental conservation. After harvested, the raw bamboo pulp is transported to our manufacturing partner, where they are processed into high-quality, eco-friendly Facial Tissues and Toilet Paper rolls for our community.

We work exclusively with trusted suppliers who share our values of ethical cultivation and sustainable practices, ensuring minimal impact on surrounding ecosystems. Bamboo, as a renewable resource, grows rapidly and regenerates naturally, making it an ideal alternative to trees for paper production. By sourcing and processing responsibly, we actively help reduce deforestation and preserve biodiversity while supporting a cleaner, greener planet.


### What markets do you serve currently?

Currently, Wype serves environmentally conscious customers across Canada and the USA. Our focus is on supporting individuals and businesses who prioritize a lifestyle change and are committed to creating a positive impact for the environment. We provide sustainable, high-quality products made without using harsh unnecessary chemicals to ultra-process and whiten tissue paper, ensuring a gentler solution for both people and the planet.
