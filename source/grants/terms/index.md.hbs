(e) Registration: Big Room will register the granted .eco Domain on behalf of the .eco Grantee using the information in the Grant Domain Information Form.

## 5. DISCLAIMER REGARDING POTENTIAL DISPUTES
5.1 All Applicants acknowledge and agree that Big Room makes no representations or warranties of any kind (express or implied) regarding the Application Process, any .eco Domain or otherwise in connection with this Program, including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Big Room makes no representations, warranties or guarantees to the Applicant with respect to the possibility or likelihood of any of the following occurring or not occurring: (a) an objection or challenge to the Applicant’s right to license, use and/or Register any .eco Domain (on the basis of intellectual property rights or otherwise), and/or (b) Big Room’s direct or indirect facilitation or permission (either pursuant to the Program or otherwise) of any person’s use and/or Registration of a domain name similar to an Approved Domain or of any domain name for a purpose similar to, that competes with or that might cause confusion with the proposed or actual use of an Approved Domain.

5.2 Big Room has no obligation to make any determination as to whether (i) an Approved Domain (or any use thereof) infringes the legal rights of any person, or (ii) any other domain name (or the use thereof by any person, including another Applicant) may infringe the legal rights of any Applicant. It is each Applicant’s sole responsibility to investigate its legal rights and the legal rights of others with respect to any Approved Domain. All Applicants acknowledge and agree that they are exclusively liable for any infringement or other liability arising out of their license, use and/or Registration of any domain name. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Big Room reserves the right to terminate any Registration of an Approved Domain if Big Room determines that the same (and/or the usage of the relevant .eco Domain) infringes the intellectual property or other rights of any person. By submitting an Application, each Applicant expressly acknowledges that participation in the Application Process and in this Program does not vest in them any rights of priority or otherwise with respect to any .eco Domains, irrespective of any intellectual property or other legal rights such Applicant may have. In addition, Applicant acknowledges and agrees that Big Room may develop, use, source, license, or otherwise implement marketing or promotional programs, business models, technology, or other intellectual property similar to information provided to Big Room in any Application or Proposed Plan, and Applicant shall not assert any claims against Big Room related to misappropriation of intellectual property contained in Applicant’s Application.

## 6. EVALUATION PROCESS
Big Room will review all Applications for compliance with the Terms and Conditions and will assess the extent to which Big Room believes the Proposed Plan is likely to contribute to the global environmental community in a meaningful way (particularly as compared with competing Applications for the same .eco Domain if the domain is a generic term), as well as the likelihood of the Applicant being able to execute the Proposed Plan successfully. In reviewing Applications, Big Room may consider all relevant factors, including, without limitation: (a) the Applicant’s experience, including past evidence of successful development and deployment of websites and/or online businesses, (b) the Proposed Plan, (c) the Applicant’s technical and operational capability; (d) Applicant’s compliance or ability to comply with all of the .eco TLD policies including without limitation the .Eco Consensus Policy and (e) the Applicant’s financial condition. In addition, Applicants acknowledge that its preferred domain name may not be available due to its inclusion on any of the following lists (the “Excluded Names”), (i) names reserved by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) or Big Room and (ii) certain premium .eco Domains. Applications including .eco Domains that are Excluded Names may be rejected. All decisions regarding the Program will be in Big Room’s sole and absolute discretion. Once an Application is approved,the Applicant will be considered a .eco Grantee. Big Room shall not be obligated to provide a response or notice of rejection to Applicants whose Applications were not approved.

## 7. CONFIDENTIALITY OF APPLICATION INFORMATION
Any information in the Application that Applicant reasonably considers in good faith to be confidential should be specifically and clearly marked and identified as such (“Confidential Information”). Unless appropriately marked and identified otherwise, Big Room will assume that all Applications and information contained therein are not confidential. A single designation that all information in an Application is considered confidential will not suffice and will not be construed by Big Room to give rise to any obligation of confidentiality. No Application may contain any information considered to be trade secrets. Except as required by applicable law, Big Room will not make publicly available or disclose to any third parties (including other Applicants, but excluding any representatives of Big Room and its affiliates that have a “need to know” for purposes of administering the Program or for purposes of providing business, financial and/or legal advice to Big Room), the Confidential Information contained in an Application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, under no circumstances shall any publicly available information, the identity of the Applicant, the requested .eco Domain(s), or a summary description of the Proposed Plan be considered Confidential Information. In the event Big Room receives multiple Applications containing similar Proposed Plans, Big Room shall have no obligation to inform any Applicant regarding any such similarities, take any other action regarding the same or ascribe any particular meaning to the existence thereof.

## 8. RESTRICTIONS
The license granted to .eco Grantee for use of Approved Domains may not be assigned, transferred, sold, or conveyed to any third party except in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of the equity or assets of the .eco Grantee and then only if the successor confirms in writing its agreement to be bound by all of the Terms and Conditions. Approved Domains may not be used for: (a) typosquatting or other deceptive or manipulative purposes intended to benefit from misdirected or unintended Internet traffic or otherwise infringing the rights of others, (b) pornography, (c) gambling, (d) disparaging the TLD, the global environmental community, Big Room, its affiliates, or their respective owners, officers, directors, members, managers, employees, agents, service providers and representatives, (e) domain parking, under construction pages, single page cost per action or other advertising related landing pages not supported by a content rich back end, (f) the promotion of violence, intolerance (regarding race, creed, religion, sexual preference, gender or political affiliation), and/or illegal activity of any kind, and/or (g) distributing malware, abusively operating botnets, phishing, piracy, trademark or copyright infringement, fraudulent or deceptive practices, counterfeiting or otherwise engaging in activity contrary to applicable law.

## 9. AGREEMENT TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS
By submitting an Application, the relevant Applicant agrees to be bound by the Terms and Conditions and represents and warrants that he, she or it has read and understands the Terms and Conditions.

## 10. MODIFICATIONS; GUIDELINES; ENFORCEABILITY
Big Room may, but is not obligated to, issue interpretive guidelines on its website or to prospective or actual Applicants regarding the Program and the Terms and Conditions. Big Room may modify any aspect of the Program, including the Terms and Conditions, from time to time, which modifications will take effect at the time they are published on Big Room’s website. If any part of the Terms and Conditions is declared invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remainder of the Terms and Conditions will be valid and enforceable as if the invalid or unenforceable part were not included therein. In addition, there shall be substituted for any invalid or unenforceable provision a suitable provision that as closely as possible approximates Big Room’s original intent.
