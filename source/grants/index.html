<div class="grants-intro">
	<p>Introducing .eco, a new top-level domain name created by and for the environmental community. .eco will launch in early 2017, but before it does, weâ€™re giving away up to 500. Eco domains to the environmental movement.</p>

	<p>Unlike other top-level domains, .eco will ONLY be available to organizations, business and people committed to positive change for the planet. Endorsed by over 50 environmental organizations including WWF and Greenpeace, .eco is a trusted verified symbol for you and others working on environmental issues.</p>

	<p>Once .eco goes live to the public in the new year, securing names will become competitive and potentially expensive. So apply before December 16, 2016 for up to three .eco domain names for your organization or upcoming campaign.</p>
