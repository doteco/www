		<p>Many Britons are opting to use a .eco domain over a .uk domain for their website. Here are some of the reasons why .eco has become popular in the UK:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Environment</strong>: Most Brits care deeply about the environment, both locally and abroad. The UK is one of the global leaders in climate action and carbon reduction. A .eco domain clearly conveys that commitment.</li>
			<li><strong>International</strong>: A .uk domain is great for websites that are strictly focused within the UK. For environmentally-focused websites that look to transcend national boundaries, a .eco domain is a perfect fit.</li>
			<li><strong>Distinction</strong>: The .uk top-level domain is already well-established within the UK. A .eco domain helps you stand out from the herd.</li>
