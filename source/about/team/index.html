				<h3>Jacob Malthouse, Co-founder</h3>
				<h5>Jacob is a persistent idealist. It turns out those were exactly the right personality traits for his decade-long adventure of bringing .eco into the world and onto the Internet.</h5>

			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Jacob’s passion for making positive change for the planet began when he traveled to a remote village in Guyana at age 21 to help build a school. Then came an internship with an environmental think tank at the University of Victoria followed by a job at the United Nations Environmental Program where his team founded the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). In 2000, Jacob was named alongside his .eco Co-founder, Trevor Bowden, as a Young Canadian Leader for a Sustainable Future by the International Institute for Sustainable Development.</p>

				<p>After the overwhelming success of PRI, Jacob hit pause on environmental work and returned  to the Caribbean for a role with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This work inspired the ICANN Fellowships program, which he designed and launched in 2007. It has since brought leaders from all around the world to the Internet’s governing body. Jacob’s combined work experience, plus an added dose of idealism, created a perfect storm and, ultimately, the vision for .eco.</p>
