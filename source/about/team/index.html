		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Understanding how something works and how it relates to its surroundings is what makes Trevor tick. Early in his career, he used this approach to help figure out how to help the investment industry incorporate sustainability into the way it managed money.  The result was the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), now endorsed by companies managing 59 trillion investment dollars. Trevor was on the team at the United Nations Environmental Programme Finance Initiative that launched PRI, along with .eco co-founder, Jacob Malthouse.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>With an M.Sc. in Public Understanding of Environmental Change from the University of London and a Diploma in Environmental Studies from McGill University, Trevor has studied the intricate relationships within ecosystems, both natural and man-made. That’s why he jumped at the chance to apply to run the .eco registry. During the decade-long endeavour to bring .eco to the Internet, his keen relationship-building skills helped secure .eco endorsements from more than 50 environmental non-profits, which ultimately won Trevor and Jacob the right to manage the .eco domain.</p>

				<h3>Jacob Malthouse, <br />Co-founder</h3>
				<p class="team-subheader">Jacob is a persistent idealist. It turns out those were exactly the right personality traits for his decade-long adventure of bringing .eco into the world and onto the Internet.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>Jacob’s passion for making positive change for the planet began when he traveled to a remote village in Guyana at age 21 to help build a school. Then came an internship with an environmental think tank at the University of Victoria followed by a job at the United Nations Environmental Program where his team founded the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). In 2000, Jacob was named alongside his .eco Co-founder, Trevor Bowden, as a Young Canadian Leader for a Sustainable Future by the International Institute for Sustainable Development.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>After the overwhelming success of PRI, Jacob hit pause on environmental work and returned  to the Caribbean for a role with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This work inspired the ICANN Fellowships program, which he designed and launched in 2007. It has since brought leaders from all around the world to the Internet’s governing body. Jacob’s combined work experience, plus an added dose of idealism, created a perfect storm and, ultimately, the vision for .eco.</p>

				<p>Michael holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in International Relations from St. Mary's University in San Antonio, TX. He began his career working for the United States Department of Justice, a job he says was transformational as it taught him about business from a legal perspective. It also motivated him to go back to school to get his Masters in International Management from Thunderbird University. Since then he has traveled the world, living in foreign countries and receiving a lifetime's worth of education from his travels. He's lived in eight countries and travelled to over 30. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>In his personal life, Michael is easy-going, he enjoys a craft beer from time to time and loves meeting people and hearing their stories. When Michael is not thinking about the next .eco opportunity he spends the majority of his time with his wife and two daughters. He also enjoys triathlons, long bike rides and running. He's already completed a half-Ironman competition and a marathon. Michael loves accomplishing the impossible, whether it's a gruelling triathlon or a tough business deal.</p>
