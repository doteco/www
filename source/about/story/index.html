		<p>For more than a decade we’ve been working with the internet and environmental communities to build .eco – an online home for businesses, non-profits and individuals working for an environmentally and socially sustainable world. Thanks to the backing of more than 50 organizations the .eco dream is now a reality. </p>

		<p>.eco is a dedicated web address ending for businesses, organizations and individuals committed to positive change for the planet. It’s a trusted symbol for environmental action and the best way to show customers and supporters that you care for the planet.</p>

		<p>Founded by two environmentalists, .eco is backed by organizations including Conservation International, United Nations Global Compact, NRDC, Greenpeace and World Business Council for Sustainable Development.</p>

		<p>Based in Vancouver, Canada, .eco is operated by <a href="https://bigroom.eco">Big Room Inc.</a>, a B Corporation.</p>
