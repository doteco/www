          "The “sport system” consists of the _realisation level_ and the _condition level_. What we do and can observe in sport takes place at the realisation level: training, games, and competitions. The conditional level comprises the conditions of facilities, materials, mobility and organisation of sport.\n",
          "These two levels are embedded in our “social system” with its overarching social, cultural, political, economic and infrastructural framework conditions. Both the direct practice of sport at the realisation level and the conditions of sport have an impact on society and the natural environment. In simplified terms, these can be divided into the areas of climate, air, resources, soil, water, flora and fauna."

Doughnut economics is currently the most comprehensive and promising model of global sustainable development. It is characterised by a hierarchy and a science-based high resolution of the sustainability dimensions. The think tank's research group is attempting to define the interfaces of sport with the segments of the “social foundation” and the “ecological ceiling” of the doughnut in such a way that it becomes immediately apparent to the actors involved what can be done to promote sustainable development in the respective segment.\n",
